# Twitter-Hashtag-Analysis-Dashboard-for-FIFAWORLDCUP2022

I utilized Selenium to scrape data from Twitter. The collected tweets were then subjected to data cleaning techniques, including removing duplicates,filteringretweets, and eliminating irrelevant information.
Next, I employed a pre-trained VADER sentiment classifier to analyze the sentiment of the cleaned tweets. This allowed me to understand the positive, negative, or neutral sentiments expressed by Twitter users regarding the FIFA World Cup 2022.
To visualize the trends and insights effectively, I utilized Power BI. By connecting the cleaned dataset and sentiment analysis results to Power BI, I created interactive visualizations such as sentiment distribution, sentiment over time, and popular hashtags.
